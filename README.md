# project_vday
My first program in Python3, using pygame to make a simple text adventure-type game.

Thought it would be fun to make a little program as a gift for my wife for Valentines day.

There are probably a lot of things that could have been done better or in a more object-oriented style, but for my first program I think it is okay.

I learned a lot about python, flow control and pygame in this project.
